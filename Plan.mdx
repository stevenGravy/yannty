Provide a tool that allows for confirming TCP connections.  Typically used for confirm connectivity to web sites, applications and databases.

Will use profiles to allow for multiple connections to check with an application. Also will have built in simple tests like https/http/tcp/mysql to individual sites.


Initially the app will be CLI and may have a graphical version in the future.
